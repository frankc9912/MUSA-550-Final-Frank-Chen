  <p>Hello everyone, My name is **Frank Chen**, the author of this project. I'm currently enrolled in a dual degree program of <span style="color: orange;">*Master of City Planning*</span> and <span style="color: orange;">*Master of Urban Spatial Analytics*</span> at University of Pennsylvania's Weitzman School of Design. Before I came to Philadelphia, I completed the 5-year undergraduate study and research at Tianjin University.<br><br>
  I'm a data enthusiast and urban planner, and I'm passionate about using data and technology to solve urban problems and make our cities more sustainable, equitable, and resilient. I'm interested in a wide range of topics, including spatial optimization, housing, urban mobility, and public health. I have experience in data analysis, spatial analysis, and data visualization, and I currently work as a research assistant at Housing Initiative at Penn.</p>
