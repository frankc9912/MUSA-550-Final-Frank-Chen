"In this section, I will show how to get the data for this project. I will give an example of using API to call the **foot traffic data** provided by [Dewey](https://www.deweydata.io/)."


### **[Exploratory Analysis](exploratory.ipynb)**
*Estimated read time: 4 min*

"In this section, I will explore the foot traffic data and the spend patterns data, and try to have more insights about the changes over time by visualizing them."

### **[Modeling](prediction.ipynb)**
*Estimated read time: 8 min*

"In this section, I will construct the model using Random Forest Regressor from the scikit-learn library. There will be 4 models in total, each with different features, and I will compare the performance of each model using the median absolute error and the R-squared score."

### **[Conclusion and Limitation](conclusion.qmd)**
*Estimated read time: 3 min*

"This project can inform business owner to strategize cost management, or adapt to changing consumer behaviors. However, the project has a key limitation: the dataset used does not cover all stores in Philadelphia but only a relatively big sample."
