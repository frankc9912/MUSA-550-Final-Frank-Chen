# Background

The retail landscape in Philadelphia has undergone significant changes between 2019 and 2024, which is caused by economic shifts, consumer behavior changes, and the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic caused widespread store closures and a sharp decline in foot traffic, leading to serious challenges for physical retail stores. For example, according to [The Sun](https://www.the-sun.com/money/12871505/supermarket-chain-closing-location-major-city/), a major supermarket chain closed its downtown Philadelphia location, leaving residents with fewer shopping options and highlighting the difficulties faced by urban retailers that rely on consistent foot traffic. Similarly, another [report](https://www.the-sun.com/money/11898078/shadow-self-shoppers-beloved-mall-expected-close/) noted that a well-loved mall with stores like Walmart and Marshalls announced it would close after 35 years because fewer people were visiting and business had dropped.

The recovery of pedestrian activity was slow in many areas, which makes businesses in some neighborhoods continuing to struggle. However, Center City began to show signs of a turnaround by 2023. According to a report by [CBRE](https://mktgdocs.cbre.com/2299/d98cac51-9a1c-4e5b-a018-532edb739c5e-10848216.pdf), tourism in Philadelphia rebounded to exceed pre-pandemic levels, helping to boost foot traffic and retail demand. Additionally, the number of retailers in Center City increased by 15% compared to 2019, reflecting renewed confidence in physical retail spaces, as noted by [Metro Philadelphia](https://metrophiladelphia.com/center-city-retail-report-philadelphia/).

This study will use **foot traffic data** from [ADVAN](https://advanresearch.com) to examine the conclusions of the reports, and use **spend patterns data** from [SafeGraph](https://www.safegraph.com/) to explore the income changes of retail stores in Phialdelphia from 2019 to 2024. Note that the spend data is aggregated by places, so it can also be seen as the income of a place.

Meanwhile, it is important to understand income trends in Philadelphia's retail sector and predict future income. This will offer valuable insights into the city's economic development, and support strategic decision-making for stakeholders like the government and developers. I will use features that are related to foot traffic and spend patterns to model the income trend. Foot traffic is a critical driver of retail success, especially for businesses that depend heavily on in-person customer interactions. Reduced pedestrian activity and cautious spending can have negative effects on local economies, contributing to store closures and declining revenues. 

In general, analyzing these trends provides valuable references for understanding broader economic patterns, including employment, real estate, and city revenues. A strong retail sector, supported by steady foot traffic and spending, can enhance neighborhood vitality and urban livability. This study aims to examine these shifts and provide insights into the factors driving Philadelphiaâ€™s retail recovery.
